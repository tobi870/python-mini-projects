# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of small, focused Python projects! I'm building these as part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), where I'm strengthening my Python fundamentals on the path to becoming a robotics engineer.

Each folder contains a self-contained project, complete with code and a short explanation.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. [Expense Tracker](./expense-tracker)
A simple command-line tool to log expenses using lambda functions, lists, and dictionaries. Built as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

### 2. [Building Cipher](./building-cipher)
Coming soon! Will implement classic encryption techniques like Caesar or Vigenère ciphers to explore string manipulation and modular arithmetic.

### 3. [Luhn Algorithm](./luhn-algorithm)
Coming soon! A Python implementation of the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers — great for learning loops and logic.
