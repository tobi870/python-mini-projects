# 🔐 Building Cipher

This upcoming project will implement simple ciphers (like Caesar or Vigenère) to encrypt and decrypt messages using Python.

---

## 📚 Context

Part of the **Scientific Computing with Python** course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This project will reinforce working with strings, loops, and modular arithmetic.

---

## 🛠️ Planned Features

- Encrypt messages using Caesar Cipher
- Optionally decrypt messages
- Explore other ciphers (Vigenère, XOR) in later versions

---

## 📌 Skills Targeted

- String manipulation
- Control flow
- Basic cryptography principles
